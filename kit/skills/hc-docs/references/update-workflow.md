# Update Workflow

## Phase 1: Parallel Codebase Scouting

1. Scan the codebase and calculate the number of files with LOC in each directory (skip `.claude`, `.opencode`, `.git`, `tests`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `secrets`, etc.)
2. Target directories **that actually exist** - adapt to project structure
3. Activate `hc:scout` skill to explore the code base and return detailed summary reports
4. Merge scout reports into context summary

## Phase 1.5: Parallel Documentation Reading

**You (main agent) must spawn readers** - subagents cannot spawn subagents.

1. Count docs: `ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l`
2. Get LOC: `wc -l docs/*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -rn`
3. Strategy:
   - 1-3 files: Skip parallel reading, haily-docs-writer reads directly
   - 4-6 files: Spawn 2-3 `Explore` agents
   - 7+ files: Spawn 4-5 `Explore` agents (max 5)
4. Distribute files by LOC (larger files get dedicated agent)
5. Each agent prompt: "Read these docs, extract: purpose, key sections, areas needing update. Files: {list}"
6. Merge results into context for haily-docs-writer

## Phase 2: Documentation Update (haily-docs-writer Agent)

**CRITICAL:** You MUST spawn `haily-docs-writer` agent via Task tool with merged reports and doc readings.

Pass the gathered context to haily-docs-writer agent to update documentation:
- `README.md`: Update README (keep it under 300 lines)
- `docs/project-overview-pdr.md`: Update project overview and PDR
- `docs/codebase-summary.md`: Update codebase summary
- `docs/code-standards.md`: Update codebase structure and code standards
- `docs/system-architecture.md`: Update system architecture
- `docs/project-roadmap.md`: Update project roadmap
- `docs/deployment-guide.md` [optional]: Update deployment guide
- `docs/design-guidelines.md` [optional]: Update design guidelines

## Phase 3: Size Check (Post-Update)

After haily-docs-writer completes:
1. Run `wc -l docs/*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -rn` to check LOC
2. Use `docs.maxLoc` from session context (default: 800)
3. For files exceeding limit: report and ask user

## Phase 4: Documentation Validation (Post-Update)

Grep-verify to detect potential hallucinations (non-blocking):
1. Re-run the Accuracy Protocol grep checks (code references, internal links, config keys) against every symbol/path just documented
2. Display findings as a report
3. Fix or remove anything that no longer resolves

## Important
- Use `docs/` directory as the source of truth.
- **Do not** start implementing.
