# Test — Test Suite Execution Pipeline

Runs the full validation pipeline: typecheck → tests → coverage → build verification. Detects language and framework automatically. `--web` loads web-specific tooling (Playwright, k6, a11y, visual regression, Core Web Vitals).

## Usage

```
{skill:hc-test} [scope] [--web] [--mutation]
```

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| *(none)* | Run project test suite: typecheck → tests → coverage → build |
| `--web` | Web-specific testing: load Playwright, k6, a11y, visual regression, CWV references |
| `--mutation` | Run mutation testing (Stryker/mutmut) scoped to critical-path modules — nightly/pre-merge tier, not the inner loop |

```
{skill:hc-test}                   # full suite
{skill:hc-test} src/auth/         # scoped to auth module
{skill:hc-test} --web             # full web test suite
{skill:hc-test} --web src/checkout # web tests scoped to checkout flow
{skill:hc-test} src/auth --mutation # mutation score for the auth module
```

No arguments: run the full project test suite. Add `--web` for web-specific testing. Add `--mutation` for a periodic mutation-score audit on critical-path modules.

## Constraints

> **Required — never-ignore-failures:** Fix root causes. Do not mock, stub, or skip tests to force a passing build. A passing build with hidden failures is worse than a failing build.

> **Required — evidence-before-claims:** Run the full test command and read its output before reporting pass/fail status.

## Process

1. **Route** — parse scope from args; select mode (standard or `--web`). Log `✓ Route: mode=[standard|web], scope=[arg or 'all']`

2. **Recon** — run `hailykit test-detect <path> --json` to identify the framework, runner command, test globs, and coverage threshold from config deterministically (returns `framework: "unknown"` when nothing matches — then fall back to manual inspection). Log `✓ Recon: framework=[name], test files=[N]`

3. **Verify** — execute validation pipeline via `references/flow-execution.md`:
   - Run typecheck/lint (catch compile errors before tests)
   - Run test suite; on failure, classify: configuration issue (missing dep, wrong env var, broken import) → fix config and re-run; code bug (logic error, assertion failure, regression) → stop and escalate per § When NOT to Use
   - Generate coverage; normalize the report with `hailykit coverage-parse <file> --json` (LCOV/Istanbul/pytest/gocover → total % + per-file %) and compare against threshold
   - Run build verification (production build must exit 0)
   - For `--web`: load and run web-specific suites (see `## --web Mode`)
   - Log `✓ Verify: [N/N] tests passed — coverage=[X%] — build=[PASS|FAIL]`

4. **Report** — produce structured QA report to `.agents/reports/` via `references/quality-report.md`. Log `✓ Report: saved to .agents/reports/[filename]`

## --web Mode

Activated by `--web`. Load these references and run suites in the order that applies to the project:

| Reference | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| `references/tech-playwright.md` | E2E — authoring, selectors, fixtures, parallel execution |
| `references/tech-k6.md` | Load — scripts, thresholds, ramp-up patterns |
| `references/tech-a11y.md` | Accessibility — axe-core, ARIA audits, WCAG compliance |
| `references/tech-visual-regression.md` | Visual regression — screenshot diffing, baseline management |
| `references/tech-core-web-vitals.md` | Core Web Vitals — LCP, CLS, INP via Lighthouse CI |
| `references/quality-cross-browser.md` | Cross-browser — Safari/Firefox compat checklist |
| `references/flow-ui.md` | UI testing workflow — browser automation, auth, reporting |

Use `{skill:hc-browser}` for interactive browser sessions and screenshot analysis. Use `gemini` CLI for describing UI issues from screenshots.

## --mutation Mode

Activated by `--mutation`. Load `references/tech-mutation.md`, detect the project's mutation tool (Stryker for JS/TS, mutmut for Python), scope the run to critical-path modules (policy/validation, orchestrators, auth, payment) or the given scope arg, and run it. Report mutation score plus surviving mutants as findings — weak or assertion-free tests to strengthen, never auto-fixed. This is a nightly/pre-merge/critical-path audit, explicitly not part of the standard typecheck→tests→coverage→build pipeline and never a per-commit gate.

## When NOT to Use

- Tests failing due to a code bug → `{skill:hc-debug}` to investigate, then `{skill:hc-fix}` to fix
- STRIDE/OWASP security audit → `{skill:hc-security}`
- Complex test failure analysis → activate `{skill:hl-reasoning}`

## Workflow Position

**Follows:** `{skill:hc-cook}` — test after implementation
**Follows:** `{skill:hc-fix}` — test after bug fix
**Precedes:** `{skill:hc-review}` — review after tests pass
**Precedes:** `{skill:hc-optimize}` — when coverage or performance falls short of target
**Related:** `{skill:hc-cook}`, `{skill:hc-fix}`

`--mutation` runs as an optional periodic quality audit after the standard suite passes — nightly, pre-merge, or on explicit request, never bundled into the pipeline above.
