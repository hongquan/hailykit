# Fiction Playbook — Short Story · Novel

Same craft criteria across both variants — arc, POV, pacing, consistency — they differ only in scale: a single Freytag arc for short fiction versus a multi-chapter three-act/beat-sheet structure for novel-length work.

Prose-level craft is split across two files: genre-neutral tells — anti-AI-tone patterns, density ceilings, show-don't-tell, specificity — in `references/craft-prose-antipatterns.md`, and fiction-only craft — hook archetypes, differentiation, expansion — in `references/craft-fiction-prose.md`. At Draft, seed `bible/style.md` with the Prose guardrails digest (from the anti-patterns file); at concept development, run the Differentiation checklist (from the fiction-craft file) before the outline Checkpoint.

## Track

Short story defaults to the short-form track. Novel always defaults to the long-form track regardless of target length — the persistent bible is mandatory the moment chapters exist, not just past a word-count threshold.

## Variant: Short Story

**Skeleton:** Freytag's Pyramid — Exposition → Rising Action → Climax → Falling Action → Denouement. Single arc, single dominant conflict; this is the classic taught structure for short fiction, as opposed to the multi-arc structures novels use.

**Mandatory "research":** comp titles/market for the target publication or contest; internal consistency of POV, tense, and timeline. No external fact-check burden unless the piece is historical or technical.

**Fabrication risks:** invented "comp" claims in a cover letter (comparing to real published stories that don't actually match); internal plot-hole or continuity breaks.

**Review criteria:**
1. All five Freytag stages are present around a single clear conflict
2. POV and tense stay consistent throughout
3. Economy — no scene bloat past what the arc needs
4. Ending resolves the setup or intentionally subverts it, not left dangling by accident

**Length:** 1,000–7,500 words; below 1,000 is flash fiction, 7,500–17,500 is a novelette.

**Unit:** typically one Build unit = the complete story. A novelette-length piece may split into 2–3 units aligned to Freytag stages (rising action / climax+falling action / denouement) at the writer's discretion.

## Variant: Novel

**Skeleton (default):** Three-Act Structure as the macro shape — Setup ~25% → Confrontation ~50% → Resolution ~25% — operationalized via Save the Cat's 15-beat sheet for chapter-level planning. Beats are percentage-anchored, giving concrete, checkable checkpoints that bare three-act framing lacks.

| Beat | % anchor |
|---|---|
| Opening Image | 0% |
| Theme Stated | 5% |
| Set-Up | 1–10% |
| Catalyst | 12% |
| Debate | 12–20% |
| Break into Two | 20% |
| B Story | 22% |
| Fun and Games | 20–50% |
| Midpoint | 50% |
| Bad Guys Close In | 50–75% |
| All Is Lost | 75% |
| Dark Night of the Soul | 75–80% |
| Break into Three | 80% |
| Finale | 80–99% |
| Final Image | 99–100% |

> **Required — beats-are-user-facing:** these beats and their %-anchors are written into `outline.md` at the Draft stage for the user to review at the outline Checkpoint — this is not a hidden internal planning aid. Once approved, the editor reuses the same beat list as its structural-check baseline at Verify.

Use Hero's Journey only as an optional overlay when the genre is fantasy or mythic-adventure (character-transformation focus, versus Save the Cat's plot-mechanics focus) — never as the default. Note the override explicitly in `outline.md` when applied.

**Rolling outline (works >30 units):** past ~30 planned units, a fully detailed single outline over-commits to beats the story will have outgrown by the time it reaches them. Detail per-unit beats for the current act only; later acts stay as skeletons (title, goal, estimated unit count, the beat %-anchors they must land). When an act closes, expand the next act's skeleton into per-unit beats — a lightweight Checkpoint (auto-proceed in `--auto` when the expansion stays within the approved skeleton's goal and beat anchors). The approved macro shape (three-act + beat %-anchors) never changes without a full outline-revision Checkpoint.

**Imported works (`references/import-mode.md`):** `outline.md` is reverse-engineered from the imported chapters' summaries, with every imported unit's beat marked `(imported)` so structural review can distinguish reconstructed beats from planner-authored ones. Continuation beats are then planned forward from `bible/plot.md § Open Threads`, and the rolling-outline rule above applies unchanged once the continuation itself grows past 30 units.

**Mandatory "research":** comp titles — real, verifiable published books, never invented for pitch copy; the genre convention/word-count target; a series/worldbuilding bible. The bible is mandatory for the novel track — Build does not begin without one seeded from the approved outline.

**Fabrication risks:** fake comp titles in pitch or query copy; worldbuilding, timeline, or magic-system rule violations across chapters — the fiction analog of factual fabrication, caught by cross-chapter continuity checks rather than citation checks.

**Review criteria:**
1. Beats land near their target percentages, not drastically off
2. Character arc stays consistent chapter-to-chapter
3. Worldbuilding and timeline stay internally consistent against the bible
4. Chapter-level hook/cliffhanger pacing holds
5. POV and tense stay consistent

**Length:** novella 17,500–40,000 words; commercial novel 70,000–100,000; literary 80,000–100,000; epic/high fantasy 100,000–150,000+. Typical chapter count 10–30 (commonly ~20).

**Unit:** one Build unit = one chapter, ~2,000–4,000 words (thrillers run shorter, fantasy longer — adjust to the brief's stated genre).

**Webnovel/truyện-đăng-kỳ serial pacing (note, not a separate variant):** a serialized web release
(Wattpad/Webnovel/truyện-đăng-kỳ platforms) keeps the same beat sheet and bible mechanics above but tightens
per-chapter pacing for a high-volume release cadence — a cliffhanger or open question at the end of every
chapter, chapters run shorter (~2,000–3,000 words) than the general novel-chapter range, and the writer/outline
plan for frequent (often daily or near-daily) releases rather than a single monolithic publication. This
changes cadence and chapter-ending craft only; beats, %-anchors, and the bible stay unchanged.

## Anti-Fabrication Guardrail (both variants)

> **Required — real-comps-only:** comp titles used in pitch, query, or proposal copy must be real, verifiable published works — never invented to sound plausible. Worldbuilding and canon rules established in the bible are binding; a chapter that contradicts them gets fixed, the bible does not silently change.
