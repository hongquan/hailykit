# Code Review Cycle

Interactive review-fix cycle used in code workflows.

Artifact contract: `references/review-artifacts.md`.

## Required Review Artifacts

Before finalize, commit, ship, push, PR, or deploy, create/update:

- `context-snippets.json`
- `risk-gate.json`
- `verification.json`
- `review-decision.json`
- `adversarial-validation.json` when auto, high-risk, large-diff, or ship-like

Artifact directory:
- Plan workflow: `.agents/<plan-dir>/reports/harness/`
- No-plan workflow: `.agents/reports/harness/<timestamp-slug>/`
- Active pointer: `.agents/workflow-artifacts.json`

Run:

```bash
node kit/hooks/haily-artifact.cjs --stage finalize --artifact-dir <artifact-dir>
```

## Elevated Scrutiny Triggers

Certain conditions demand additional review layers beyond the standard haily-reviewer:

| Surface area | Extra reviewer |
|---|---|
| Autonomous execution (`--auto` flag) | adversarial challenge |
| Security-sensitive surfaces (auth flows, credential handling, payment logic) | domain risk audit |
| Data-layer mutations (schema changes, migration scripts) | domain risk audit |
| External contracts (public API shapes, exported types, env var contracts) | domain risk audit |
| Infrastructure touchpoints (CI pipelines, deploy configs, release scripts) | domain risk audit |
| Destructive operations (bulk file deletion, data wipes, irreversible writes) | domain risk audit |
| High-volume outbound actions or large diffs (ship / push / PR / deploy) | adversarial challenge |

Under `--deep`, the domain risk audit runs unconditionally — regardless of which surface area the phase touches — in addition to any trigger above.

There is no averaging or majority-vote logic. A single evidenced critical finding is sufficient to block. Under `--deep`, this rule operates on refuter-surviving findings: a Critical that the refuter vote (`{skill:hc-review}` `--deep`) does not overturn still blocks alone; a Critical the refuter successfully disproves does not count toward the threshold.

## Interactive Review Loop (3-round cap)

```
rounds_left = 3

REPEAT:
  reviewer  ← spawn haily-reviewer → writes review-decision.json
  IF elevated_scrutiny_trigger:
    spawn adversarial / domain reviewer → writes adversarial-validation.json + risk-gate.json
  gate ← run artifact validator

  present: verdict, score, blockers, warnings, artifact location

  IF blockers exist:
    choice ← AskUserQuestion ["Resolve blockers", "Abort"]
    IF resolve AND rounds_left > 0:
      apply fixes → re-run tests → rounds_left -= 1 → REPEAT
    IF resolve AND rounds_left == 0:
      AskUserQuestion ["Accept remaining risks and proceed", "Abort workflow"]
  ELSE:
    choice ← AskUserQuestion ["Approve", "Address warnings", "Abort"]
    IF address warnings AND rounds_left > 0:
      apply fixes → rounds_left -= 1 → REPEAT
    IF approve → PROCEED
```

## Autonomous Review (`--auto`)

In `--auto` mode the agent operates without human pauses. It resolves what it can, and exits with a written report when it cannot.

```
budget = 3   # max self-repair attempts

REPEAT:
  spawn haily-reviewer → review-decision.json
  populate risk-gate.json
  IF elevated scrutiny required → spawn adversarial validator
  run artifact gate

  WHEN verdict == PASS AND gate clears:
    → auto-approve, continue pipeline

  WHEN blocker detected AND budget > 0:
    → select lowest-risk remediation (prefer undo over patch)
    → re-run affected tests + gate
    → budget -= 1 → REPEAT

  WHEN budget exhausted OR hard block:
    → write incident report to .agents/reports/cook-incident-{slug}.md
       (contents: root cause, attempted fixes, suggested next action)
    → terminate run — no interactive prompt
```

Score is never sufficient for approval. `score >= 9.5` is only a confidence signal.

**Apex remediation verdict (tier-gated):** when `HL_MODEL_TIER` ranks below `ultra`, the `select lowest-risk remediation` step hands the choice to the `haily-judge` agent as a decision package — the blocker evidence, the candidate remediations (undo the affected slice / patch forward / propagate the new contract / compatibility adapter), and a Blast-Radius + Reversibility rubric — at most twice per run. At an `ultra` session, skip the extra spawn: the session already judges at the top tier. If the `ultra` spawn is unavailable or errors, fall back to the session's own selection with the notice `⚠ apex judge unavailable — verdict by session model`. The judge picks among technical remediations only — it never accepts risk on the user's behalf: a hard block (data loss, security hole, broken public contract) still terminates with the incident report exactly as above. Record the verdict as one line in the incident report or the phase's Deviation Log so the run can be audited after the fact.

## Adversarial Challenge Prompt

```
Stress-test the implementation of <phase> — your job is to find what breaks, not what looks nice.
Focus exclusively on: functional correctness, acceptance-criteria gaps, regression paths through shared code, and contract stability.
Out of bounds: style preferences, alternative architectures, nice-to-have suggestions.
Structured output (JSON-ready):
- verdict: CLEAR | RISKS_NOTED | BLOCKED
- falsePositives[]: review claims that don't hold under scrutiny
- gaps[]: acceptance criteria lacking proof
- evidenceNeeded[]: assertions without test or manual verification
- regressionPaths[]: call chains through modified code that could break
```

## Output Formats

- Waiting: `Step 5: Code reviewed - [decision], validator [pass|warn|block] - WAITING`
- After fix: `Step 5: Fixed [N] blockers - validator pass - Approved`
- Auto-approved: `Step 5: Review PASS - validator pass - Auto-approved`
- High-risk stop: `Step 5: High-risk auto stop - human approval required before finalize`
