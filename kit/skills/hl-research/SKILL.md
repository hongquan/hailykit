# hl:research — Technical Intelligence

Multi-source research from scope definition to actionable report. **YAGNI · KISS · DRY.**

## Usage

```
{skill:hl-research} <topic> [--quick | --deep] [--type eval|security|migration|arch]
```

| Mode | Searches | Time | Use when |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| *(default)* | 5 parallel | ~10 min | Standard evaluation or best-practice check |
| `--quick` | 2 parallel | ~5 min | Sanity check — is this library maintained? does this pattern exist? |
| `--deep` | 8–10 parallel + cross-validation | ~20 min | Architecture decision, production migration, security audit |

| `--type` flag | Output template | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `eval` (default) | Comparison matrix + ranked recommendation | Choosing between 2+ options |
| `security` | CVEs + affected versions + patch status + mitigations | Security review or audit |
| `migration` | From/to state + gotchas + order of operations | Planning an upgrade or migration |
| `arch` | Case studies + trade-offs + when NOT to use | Architecture pattern evaluation |

## Constraints

> **Required — parallel searches:** Run all search calls concurrently. Never run searches sequentially when they are independent.

> **Required — recency first:** Prioritize information from the last 12 months unless historical context is explicitly needed. For security topics, always check for recent CVEs and advisories.

> **Required — source credibility weighting:** Official docs and maintainer blogs outrank tutorials. Production case studies outrank theoretical analysis. See `references/research-protocol.md` for the full credibility ladder.

> **Required — read by tier (token discipline):** Use search snippets for breadth. Full-fetch a source (`{skill:hc-lookup}` / WebFetch) ONLY for the 1–3 highest-credibility (Tier 1–2) results. Never full-read low-tier pages — that is the token sink this skill exists to avoid.

> **Required — sufficiency gate:** Stop gathering once every evaluation criterion has ≥1 Tier 1–2 source. If forward search leaves a criterion unmet, dry, or contradictory, switch to the **inversion pass** (`references/research-protocol.md` § Inversion Techniques) — never pad with low-tier sources or infer to fill the gap.

## Process

1. **Scope** — decompose the topic into explicit sub-questions, then map each to a search angle (targeted queries beat repeated rewording — fewer wasted searches). Identify recency requirements, evaluation criteria, depth limits. Select `--type` from topic keywords if unspecified. If the question is already inverted (signals: "why avoid", "origin of", "is X actually", "why is there no"), open with the inversion pass instead of forward fan-out.

2. **Gather** — use the session's native search tool. Apply Query Fan-Out: each parallel search covers a distinct angle (official docs, security, performance, community sentiment, comparisons). Read by tier (snippet-first; full-fetch only Tier 1–2 via `{skill:hc-lookup}`/WebFetch). See `references/research-protocol.md` for query templates.
   - `--quick`: 2 searches (essential facts + community health)
   - *(default)*: 5 searches covering all angles
   - `--deep`: 8–10 searches; follow ≤2 highest-value leads (one hop)
   - **Sufficiency gate:** once every criterion has a Tier 1–2 source, STOP (don't run remaining angles). If a criterion stays dry/contradictory → run a bounded **inversion pass** (≤2–3 reverse queries, technique chosen by why forward failed — see protocol).

3. **Synthesize** — identify patterns, pros/cons, maturity, security, compatibility; flag consensus vs. controversy. *(default + `--deep`)* For ≤3 highest-stakes or contested claims, run **active refutation**: search to *disprove* the claim, not re-confirm it. Tag each `VERIFIED` / `UNVERIFIED` / `CONTESTED`.

4. **Report** — save to `.agents/reports/research-YYMMDD-HHMM-{slug}.md`. Select output template based on `--type`. Cite the source inline for every non-obvious claim.

## --ultra Mode

Active only when the turn was started via `{skill:hl-ultra}` (it passes the internal `--ultra` marker) — never self-activated, never suggested. Turn-scoped: every skill in the chain sees it. If the user types `--ultra` directly, redirect to `{skill:hl-ultra}` — a bare flag escalates subagents only while the main loop stays on the session model.

- Task calls to deep-eligible agents (`haily-planner`, `haily-implementor`, `haily-reviewer`, `haily-brainstormer`, `haily-debugger`) pass `model: {model:deep}`.
- All other agents keep their pinned tiers — escalate judgment, not mechanics.
- If the deep model is unavailable, retry once with the thinking tier and tell the user which model ran.

## Workflow Position

**Precedes:** `{skill:hl-brainstorm}` — research findings inform option evaluation; `{skill:hc-plan}` — research informs phase design
**Precedes:** `{skill:hl-mindmap}` — when research surfaces entities and relationships worth persisting as a navigable graph
**Used alongside:** `{skill:hc-lookup}` — fetch library/repo docs during gather stage

**Versus native `/deep-research`:** on Claude Code, for an exhaustive, open-ended, fact-checked **prose report** where high token cost is acceptable, prefer `/deep-research`. hl-research is the bounded, predictable-cost tier that produces **structured decision artifacts** (comparison matrix, CVE table, migration map) — and it runs on every provider, not just Claude.
