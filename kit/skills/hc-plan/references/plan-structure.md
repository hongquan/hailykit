# Plan Structure

## Directory Layout

Plans are created in `.agents/[YYMMDD]-[HHMM]-[slug]/` using the naming pattern from the `## Naming` section injected by hooks.

# Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

Brief description of what this plan accomplishes and why.

## Phases

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | [Setup Environment](./phase-01-setup.md) | pending |
| 2 | [Core Implementation](./phase-02-core.md) | pending |
| 3 | [Tests](./phase-03-tests.md) | pending |

## Dependencies

- List cross-plan dependencies with justification
```

**Link text must be human-readable names, not filenames.**
Keep plan.md under 80 lines — it is an index, not a specification.

## Phase File Structure

See `references/phase-template.md` for the full template. Key sections:
```
phase, title, status, priority, effort, dependencies, tier
---
Overview · Requirements · Architecture
Related Files · Implementation Steps · Success Criteria · Risk Notes
```

**`tier` field** — model tier hint for this phase. Auto-classified by hc-plan; passed to hc-cook by hc-goal for cost routing:
- `fast` — mechanical work: renames, boilerplate, docs, config edits
- `medium` — standard logic: CRUD, integration, refactors (default)
- `thinking` — complex reasoning: architecture decisions, security, schema design, novel algorithms

Absent `tier` field: behaves as `medium` (backward compatible).

## Cross-Plan References

- Bare slug: `260301-1200-auth-system` → same scope as current plan
- `global:260301-1200-auth-system` → global plans root
- `project:260301-1200-auth-system` → project plans root

Missing references warn and show `not found` — they do not block plan creation.

## --deep and --tdd Extensions

**`--deep`:** Add to each phase file:
- File inventory table (file, action, estimated size, test impact)
- Test scenario matrix (critical, high, medium paths)
- Phase dependency map calling out cross-phase links

**`--tdd`:** Add to each phase file — which section applies depends on whether the phase introduces new behavior or refactors existing behavior (`{skill:hc-cook}` `references/process-steps.md` § --tdd Flag Behavior):

- **New behavior → Red-Green:**
  - **Failing Tests** — test(s) for the new behavior, written from this phase's spec/acceptance criteria; run and capture the failing output (red proof) before any implementation edit
  - **Test-only commit** — committed before implementation starts; the implementor may not edit these files
  - **Implementation** — code to green against the committed tests
  - **Refactor** — cleanup once green
- **Refactor/legacy → Snapshot:**
  - **Tests Before** — regression stubs written before any code changes
  - **Refactor** — protected implementation changes
  - **Tests After** — new behavior tests, if any incidental new behavior surfaces
- Regression gate: compile+test command that must pass before proceeding (both cycles)
