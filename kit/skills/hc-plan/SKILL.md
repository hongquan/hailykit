# Plan — Phased Implementation Roadmaps

Turns a task description into a structured, phased plan through research, codebase analysis, and adversarial review. Never writes implementation code — only plan artifacts.

## Usage

```
{skill:hc-plan} <task> [--quick] [--deep] [--auto] [--tdd]
{skill:hc-plan} red-team [plan-path]
{skill:hc-plan} validate [plan-path]
```

If invoked without arguments or with ambiguous intent, use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Planning Operation") to clarify task scope before proceeding.

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| *(none)* | Interactive — agent auto-detects research depth; pauses at each Checkpoint |
| `--quick` | Skip Research + Red Team + Validation. Go straight to Codebase Analysis → Solution Design → Plan Writing. Use when you already know the codebase and approach — small features, bug fixes, or well-understood refactors. |
| `--deep` | Force maximum depth: 2–3 researchers + per-phase scout + red-team + validation. Use for architecture decisions where the cost of a wrong approach is high. |
| `--auto` | Autonomous — agent decides all trade-offs, no stops. Composes with `--deep` or `--quick`. |
| `--tdd` | Behavioral modifier — adds a tests-first structure block to each phase |

Flags compose freely: `--quick --auto`, `--deep --auto`, `--tdd --auto`, `--deep --tdd --auto`. `--quick` and `--deep` are mutually exclusive — `--deep` wins if both given.

**Research depth auto-detection (default and `--auto`):** Agent assesses task complexity from description and codebase context — simple features get lightweight research; complex/cross-cutting changes get deeper research. Override with `--deep` when you know the decision warrants maximum scrutiny regardless of apparent complexity.

**Parallel phase detection:** Agent builds a dependency graph from phase dependencies and identifies phases that can execute in parallel. Interactive: offers parallel; `--auto`: parallelizes automatically.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Reference | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| `red-team` | `references/red-team-workflow.md` | Spawn adversarial reviewers against a draft plan |
| `validate` | `references/validate-workflow.md` | Run a critical-questions interview before coding starts |

## Process

```
Scope Check → Research → Codebase Analysis → Solution Design
→ Plan Writing → Red Team → Validation → Task Hydration → Cook Handoff → Journal
```

| Stage | Detail | Skip condition |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Scope Check** | Confirm task boundaries before spending research cycles | Trivially small task |
| **Research** | Spawn `haily-researcher` subagents in parallel — `references/research-phase.md` | `--quick`; research reports already provided |
| **Codebase Analysis** | Read relevant files, patterns, constraints — `references/codebase-analysis.md` | Scout reports already provided |
| **Solution Design** | Evaluate approach options, select best fit — `references/solution-design.md` | — |
| **Plan Writing** | Produce `plan.md` + phase files — `references/plan-structure.md`, `references/plan-quality.md` | — |
| **Red Team** | `{skill:hc-plan} red-team {plan-path}` — `references/red-team-workflow.md` | `--quick`; default: auto on `--deep`; Interactive: Checkpoint |
| **Validation** | `{skill:hc-plan} validate {plan-path}` — `references/validate-workflow.md` | `--quick`; default: auto on `--deep`; Interactive: Checkpoint |
| **Task Hydration** | `TaskCreate` per phase when CLI available; falls back to `TodoWrite` | Fewer than 3 phases |
| **Cook Handoff** | Print absolute plan path and `{skill:hc-cook}` invocation (MANDATORY) | — |
| **Log** | `{skill:hl-log}` on completion — records plan decisions and outcomes to session log | — |

Cross-plan dependency analysis: `references/plan-dependencies.md`

## Output

Plans save to `.agents/[YYMMDD]-[HHMM]-[slug]/`:

- `plan.md` — overview table with phase status, links, and key dependencies
- `phase-01-name.md`, `phase-02-name.md`, … — per-phase: requirements, file ownership, implementation steps, success criteria, risk notes

Phase file template: `references/phase-template.md`

## Constraints

> **Required — YAGNI/KISS/DRY:** Plans must not speculate features beyond what the task explicitly requires. Every phase must earn its existence. If a phase can be collapsed into an adjacent one without losing clarity, collapse it.

> **Required — plan before code:** `{skill:hc-cook}` must not execute against a task that lacks a plan. This skill produces the plan artifact that cook consumes. Do not write implementation code during planning.

## Database Phases

When any phase involves schema design, migrations, query optimization, or DB selection, activate `{skill:hc-db}` for domain guidance before detailing that phase's steps.

## Agent / LLM Phases

When any phase involves LLM context design, agent memory, token optimization, or multi-agent coordination, consult `{skill:hl-context-engineering}` for domain guidance before detailing that phase's steps.

## MCP Server Plans

When the task is building or agentizing an MCP server, the Cook Handoff must invoke `{skill:hc-mcp-builder}` instead of `{skill:hc-cook}`.

## --ultra Mode

Active only when the turn was started via `{skill:hl-ultra}` (it passes the internal `--ultra` marker) — never self-activated, never suggested. Turn-scoped: every skill in the chain sees it. If the user types `--ultra` directly, redirect to `{skill:hl-ultra}` — a bare flag escalates subagents only while the main loop stays on the session model.

- Task calls to deep-eligible agents (`haily-planner`, `haily-implementor`, `haily-reviewer`, `haily-brainstormer`, `haily-debugger`) pass `model: {model:deep}`.
- All other agents keep their pinned tiers — escalate judgment, not mechanics.
- If the deep model is unavailable, retry once with the thinking tier and tell the user which model ran.

## Workflow Position

**Follows:** `{skill:hl-brainstorm}` — after exploring approach options
**Follows:** `{skill:hc-scout}` — after codebase discovery
**Precedes:** `{skill:hc-cook}` — hands off plan path for implementation
**Related:** `{skill:hl-brainstorm}`, `{skill:hc-cook}`, `{skill:hc-scout}`
