# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### 🚀 Improvements

- session: `haily-session.cjs` emits a one-line `standards: <list>|none detected` visibility summary reflecting only standards that actually resolve to a shipped file, so a stack-detection miss is visible instead of silent; `context.cjs` `buildLangStandardsSection` emits a one-line "no standards file shipped" note when a language is detected but unmapped
- contextual rules: add `kit/contextual/` (`orchestration-protocol.md`, `team-coordination-rules.md`, `review-audit-self-decision.md`), previously unshipped despite being referenced by the trigger table; triggers now also match current slash-command forms (`/hc-review`, `/hc-security`, `/hc-cook`, `/hc-goal`, `/hc-plan`) alongside legacy keywords, with per-file dedup so a file injects at most once per prompt
- docs: `docs/engineering-standards.md` § Depth Tiers defines a single canonical two-direction parity hint (upward: ultra tier + `--deep` requested — advisory that `--deep` adds little, flag still honored; downward: tier below ultra + high-risk domain — advisory suggesting `--deep`, never auto-escalates) with the Route stage as the uniform emission point; `hc-debug`, `hc-security`, `hc-fix`, `hc-review`, `hc-cook`, `hc-plan` carry the same sentence shape
- hl-write: add academic writing playbooks — thesis/dissertation (Luận văn ThS / Luận án TS / international thesis) and literary criticism (close-reading essay / phê bình chân dung tác giả / review)
- hl-write: add `citation-styles.md` reference — 6 styles (APA 7, MLA 9, Chicago Notes-Biblio, Chicago Author-Date, IEEE, Vancouver) with mechanically-checkable rules, check tiers, and Vietnamese/East-Asian name-order conventions
- hl-write: IMRaD skeleton gains Abstract and Keywords sections
- hl-write: extended copyedit/fact-check rubrics in `review-passes.md` (citation-format validation, verbatim-quote fixed-string checking, primary-text provenance exclusion)
- haily-editor: streamlined manifest handling for references and playbooks
- scripts: check-skill-cross-refs now validates file paths in SKILL.md References tables
- hl-research: add `--type academic` (scholarly/literature-review research — meta-analysis-first credibility ladder, citation-walking, replication-aware refutation) and `--type market` (market/competitive research — filings-first ladder, press-release-as-low-tier, competitor matrix output)
- hl-write: add six genre playbooks — research proposal (đề cương/thuyết minh NCKH/PhD application/international grant), VN administrative documents (công văn/tờ trình/báo cáo/quyết định per Nghị định 30/2020), marketing copy (press release/landing page/email sequence), speech (persuasive/informative/ceremonial/toast-eulogy), career documents (resume-CV/cover letter), and educational content (textbook-tutorial/lesson-plan); adds a routing table to `hl-write/SKILL.md` disambiguating 8 genre collisions
- review-passes.md: add a severity carve-out letting a playbook designate load-bearing sourced-claim classes (this wave: legal citations in administrative documents, testimonials in marketing copy) as Critical, not Major, when unsourced

### 🐛 Fixes

- haily-rules: fix a wiring bug (`buildReminderContext` called with a positional string instead of an options object) that made the `UserPromptSubmit` reminder hook write the literal string `[object Object]` to stdout on every prompt since v1.0.0 — rules, language/framework standards, contextual rules, paths, plan context, and naming injection are now real content again; wires up the previously-unused 5-minute TTL dedup helpers so the heavy block is capped per session+cwd scope while keyword/skill-triggered contextual rules still fire every matching prompt
- hc-db: correct stale path reference

## [1.14.0] (2026-07-08)

### 🚀 Improvements

- depth-tier: standardize `--quick` / normal / `--deep` as the shared depth axis across eligible skills, with cost framing (cheapest / baseline / 3–5×) and a single `haily.json` `deep.auto` opt-in schema (`docs/engineering-standards.md` → Depth Tiers)
- hc-plan: `--deep` runs a 2-lens judge panel at Solution Design plus red-team and validation
- hc-review, hc-security: `--deep` adds refuter votes — 2–3 independent skeptics must fail to overturn a Critical finding before it can block
- hc-debug, hc-fix: `--deep` spawns a parallel hypothesis panel (2–3 falsification streams) in place of single-stream tracing
- hc-cook, hc-goal: `--deep` forwards judge-panel/refuter-vote rigor through Verify and phase delegation
- hl-brainstorm: `--deep` as an alias for `--debate --edges` — no new machinery, the 9-persona debate is already the maximum-scrutiny panel
- cross-model review (`--cross` / `crossReview.auto`) never auto-activates from `--deep` alone on any skill; when both are authorized, `--deep` upgrades cross findings from advisory to confidence-raising
- session: add `HL_MODEL_TIER` (fast|medium|thinking|ultra), written once at session start and compared by ordinal rank everywhere it gates behavior
- hc-cook, hc-plan, hc-review, hc-fix, hc-debug: parity hints suggest `--deep` when session tier is below `ultra` and the task touches a high-risk domain — advisory only, never auto-escalates
- hc-cook: add Verify-by-Execution (runs prove behavior instead of assuming it) at normal and `--deep` depth
- hc-fix: rename `--hotfix` to `--quick` for consistency with the shared depth axis
- config: migrate `.hl.json` to `haily.json` across hooks, CLI, and skill docs
- agents: add `haily-judge` (apex adjudication agent, `model: ultra`, read-only) — wired into `--deep` verdict points in hc-plan (judge synthesis, red-team), hc-review (refuter adjudication), and hc-debug (hypothesis convergence), with session-model fallback when unavailable
- hc-cook: Recon pre-Build pass injects 2–3 idiomatic in-repo exemplars (`file:line`, ≤80 lines) into the implementor prompt, with a greenfield escape hatch when no precedent exists
- subagent context: add a tier-gated `'reason'` scaffold (competing hypotheses → cited evidence → verdict + confidence) alongside the existing `'think'` directive for judgment agents below `ultra`
- hc-review, hc-fix: append accepted findings to a local `review-history.jsonl`; a 3rd same-category+module recurrence proposes a distillation target (standards entry, guard pattern, lint rule, or memory note) — always a user-approved checkpoint, never a silent write
- hc-plan: phase template gains an `## Assumptions` ledger (claim + confidence + verification method); hc-cook verifies the top-3 low/medium-confidence entries per phase before Build and halts (interactive) or defers (`--auto`) on a failed assumption
- hc-cook: Build gate adds an external-API contract check for untyped/loosely-typed paths — new import with zero prior call sites must be verified via `{skill:hc-lookup}` before Finalize (typed languages already covered by typecheck)
- haily-artifact: `execution-evidence.json` is now a conditionally-required ship-gate artifact — required iff Scope Contract recorded an `evidence: "expected"` marker on `context-snippets.json`; legacy plan dirs without the marker are unaffected

### 🐛 Fixes

- haily-artifact: fix a wiring bug (`readArtifacts()` return shape mismatch) that made the ship/push/pr/deploy artifact gate throw internally and silently fail open on every invocation — shape, policy, and secret-scan validation now actually run before ship
